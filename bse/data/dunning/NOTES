Notes about Dunning basis sets
==============================

Calcium basis sets
------------------

koput2002a is cited for several basis sets for Ca. The paper only has
details for cc-PVQZ and cc-PV5Z. The others have not yet been published
(as of March 2018).  According to Dr. J. Grant Hill, this paper is still
typically referenced for the other basis sets in the absence.
