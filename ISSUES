Current issues to be worked on:
    1.) What to do with references (probably a separate file in some format)
    2.) Some basis sets redefine some pieces? 6-31GSS is mostly 6-31G. It
        is probably very hard to handle this automatically, but maybe Lori's
        tables can help?

        a.) To handle automatically, find duplicates and change the *.atom.json
            and *.table.json files, and remove from the base files?
            That might actually be possible
